    `The digital marketing and advertising firm known as InkRevenue was established by two friends who shared a passion for the field. Saksham Khanda and Aditya Saraswat, the company's founders, possess extensive knowledge of advertising and marketing technology. After trying a few different ideas, they discovered that InkRevenue was their most successful endeavour.`,
