    "From Flexible Hours To ESOP, InkRevenue Innovates To Hire More People",
  paragraphs: [
    `InkRevenue promotes a hybrid model work structure as it offers employees the autonomy to choose to work (Work from home or Office). The company believes that satisfied employees are more likely to be productive, which contributes to overall business success. Also, the company is going to provide ESOP facilities to the new joiners.`,
    `ESOPs are tax-exempt trusts, and profits earned by the company stay with the employees — and that's only the beginning. With ESOPs, an employee will benefit from acquiring the company's shares at a nominal rate. InkRevenue believes in quick appraisals, the First one in 6 months, the Second after 9 months & then the yearly appraisal.`,
